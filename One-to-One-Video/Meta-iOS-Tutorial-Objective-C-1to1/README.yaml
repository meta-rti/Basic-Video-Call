        5. Open `Wuji iOS Tutorial.xcodeproj` and edit the `AppID.swift` file. In the `wujiKit` declaration, update `<#Your App Id#>` with your app ID, and assign the token variable with the temp Access Token generated from dashboard.

            ``` Swift
            let AppID: String = <#Your App ID#>
            // assign Token to nil if you have not enabled app certificate
            let Token: String? = <#Temp Token#>
            ```
